# Course-Recommendation-System
### Project Abstract
Nowadays there are many courses available for learners and sometimes it is hard for them to perceive information related to those courses and decide which course to take. This project aims to build a system to suggest online courses to users based on their course history and the similarity with other users. In this project we use collaborative filtering techniques to extract the information and suggest online courses. 

Collaborative filtering technique uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. Collaborative Recommender systems try to predict a userâ€™s utility for an item based on other userâ€™s previous utility with the item. The model can help users discover new interests. 

In isolation, the system may not know the user is interested in a given course, but the model might still recommend it because similar users are interested in that course
